# My Resources

Resources collected along the way.

> Creating websites is my passion, a journey where I constantly learn new things. It's easy to forget these valuable insights, so I've decided to create a personal website â€“ my second brain. It might sound a bit ambitious, but I'll do my best to organize everything neatly. This is where I'll store all my newfound knowledge, like a digital diary of my web development adventure. As I learn and grow, my website will become a treasure trove of information, making sure I never lose track of what I've learned.
